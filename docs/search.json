I focused on studying data from biological technologies (mass spectrometers and sequencing machines) and developing methods to analyze that data.\nIt was a happy and fortuitous occasion that I decided to take the course Causal Inference in Public Health during my 3rd year. I was immediately drawn in by the goals, tools, and application areas of the field—causal inference researchers really seemed to be studying meaningful and impactful issues. While I had little time to explore more of causal inference for the remainder of my graduate studies, the fascination stuck with me.\nWhen I got to Macalester in 2018, the possibility of engaging more with causal inference opened up. I taught the first version of this course in Spring 2019 and have been steadily learning more over the years, improving this course along the way. I hope that you find ideas that intrigue you and applications that excite you.\nLet’s have a great semester!"

A negative climate may create barriers to learning, while a positive climate can energize students’ learning (e.g., Pascarella & Terenzini, cited in How Learning Works, 2012).\nFor these reasons, I will be designing our in-class group activities to intentionally foster community and connectedness. You can help cultivate our classroom community by being thoughtful about the way you engage with others in class."

We only have a short time together, and fields evolve constantly. There will be many times in your career where you will need to learn on your own. What you will need to rely on when you leave Macalester is what I want to ensure you cultivate now: a good learning process. And the cornerstone of a good learning process is reflection.\nReflection is not just fundamental to learning content–it’s fundamental to learning any sort of intellectual, emotional, or physical skill. For this reason, I will be prioritizing reflection in our activities and assignments throughout the semester."

    "text": "My philosophy\nGrading is thorny issue for many educators because of its known negative effects on learning and motivation. Nonetheless, it is ever-present in the US education system and at Macalester. Because I am required to submit grades for this course, it’s worth me taking a minute to share my philosophy about grading with you.\nWhat excites me about being a teacher is your learning.\nLearning flourishes in an environment where you find meaning and value in what we’re exploring, feel supported when engaging with challenges, receive useful feedback, and regularly reflect on your learning.\nIf I didn’t have to give grades, I wouldn’t. But because I am required to, it is important to me to create a course structure and grading system that allow learning to flourish:\n\nFinding meaning and value: I am striving to achieve this by:\n\nCreating space for authentic connection between you, your peers, and myself\nBuilding flex days into our schedule so that you have time to focus on what you want to get out of the course\nEncouraging you to explore a topic that intrigues you for our course project\n\nSupport in engaging with challenges: The assignments and activities that we will use to learn are meant to be challenging, and it would be unreasonable for me to expect that you have perfect understanding on the first try. For this reason, the opportunity to revise without penalty on assignments is something I believe in strongly. Solid learning does not happen under excessive stress, and I think that a lot of that stress comes from the general culture of perfection in academia.\nReceiving useful feedback and reflecting regularly: My aim with feedback is to always provide guidance towards improvement, no matter where you are in your progress. However, good feedback alone is useless—learners need to engage deeply with feedback in order to benefit the most from it. For this reason, my stance on feedback is the following: I only want to give feedback on work that you want to read feedback on. This informs the approach that we’ll take for assignments in this course."

    "text": "Assignments and assessments\nThere are no in-class examinations (like quizzes or exams) in this course. A portfolio and a course project are the two sources of submitted work that will receive feedback.\n\nPortfolio\nPurpose: Over the course of the semester, you’ll build up a portfolio in which you organize course ideas that are most important to you in a way that is most beneficial to your future self. My hope is that you can easily use this portfolio in the future in case you want a reference that is tailored to you.\nOverview:\n\nStarting the 3rd week of the semester, an assignment will be due every Friday in which you add to this portfolio.\nThese assignments will ask you to reorganize the information from course topics in a way that is more optimal for you to navigate. In completing these assignments, you have the freedom to draw from class activities, but you will need to add explanations, transitions between ideas, and connections that we won’t necessarily do together in class activities.\nMost of the time, you’ll submit these assignments as Quarto files (.qmd) because you’ll be required to include both code and writing. I’ll add comments directly to your .qmd file and re-upload them as feedback on Moodle.\n\nDetails for all assignments can be found on the Assignments page.\n\n\nProject\nPurpose: Complete a project that you would be proud to talk about in depth during a job interview or present during MSCS Capstone Days in the spring.\nOverview:\n\nTwo main options for the project are available: (1) a data analysis using causal tools and (2) creating a tutorial on a topic not covered in class. If you feel strongly about pursuing a different type of project, we can meet to discuss.\nThrough weekly milestones at the end of the semester, you will make steady progress on your projects and iterate on feedback.\n\nFull details about the project can be found on the Project page."

Everyone has different sources of motivation and thrives in different types of environments, and I would like to learn more about each of your motivations before making decisions on a system that could have notable impacts on your experience in the course.\nAssignment 1 will be a short piece of writing that helps me learn about you in this regard. We will use insights from your writing to inform a discussion on the grading system in the first weeks of class.\n\n\n\nConsistent themes that I saw throughout your responses to Assignment 1 included the following:\n\nThe idea of an A as a default starting point was intriguing to try given the existence of other strong motivators. Many of you mentioned that the desire to learn more about the field and to create a project you would be proud to share with others are powerful sources of motivation. Given these motivators, a system where an A is the default can relieve stress and encourage a focus on ideas rather than a preoccupation with performance on assessments.\nIt would feel better if a grade of an A as a default were linked with expectations. You offered ideas of earning an A contingent on coming to class most of the time and completing assignments rather than on “perfecting” assignments according to some point scale or rubric.\nQualitative feedback, reflection, and revision are essential parts of the learning process and should be part of the grading system. Some of you expressed the desire to require revisions and reflection in response to thoughtful qualitative feedback.\nIt is important to get everyone’s input and hear what others have to say. Many of you mentioned being open to whatever grading system works best for everyone and that a fair way to decide could be to vote or have an in-class discussion.\n\n\nBased on these themes, I am proposing the following Contract for an A this semester:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContract for an A\n\n\n\nTo earn an A for the semester, we agree to the following:\n\nActively co-create our course learning community alongside peers and the instructor.\n\nOur strongest learning will occur when we feel like we’re doing work alongside others who want the same things.\nBeing an active co-creator of our learning community will entail coming prepared to class as much as we can: engaging with pre-class materials thoughtfully by noting down interesting ideas and questions that you hope to have answered and sharing them with peers in class.\nWe will support the learning of our peers by thoughtfully engaging with class activities.\nEveryone will advocate for their own learning by communicating regularly with the instructor about what is working well and can be improved.\n\nComplete all assignments to the best of your ability and consistently respond to feedback.\n\nResponding to feedback involves revising work and/or writing a message to the instructor to continue the conversation from the previous round of feedback.\nQualitative feedback will always communicate areas for growth. Sometimes that growth can be approached with a revision of prior work, and sometimes it can be approached by articulating plans for what to work on in the future.\n\nReflect on your progress at the midway point and at the end of the semester.\n\nI will provide prompts at both points to help you look back on past work and look forward to continued growth.\n\nCreate and present a high quality project that you would be proud to share on capstone days or with future employers.\n\nThrough regular milestones and qualitative feedback on each milestone, we’ll work towards creating work that you are proud of."

We must be mindful of when it might hinder us and when it might provide us with new understanding and/or assistance. What is most important to me about our AI usage in this course is the following:\n\nAI usage must always be cited with the prompt and full output.\n\nWhy do I care about this? I want to see and give feedback on your thinking.\nI will not use AI frequently out of personal preference, but when I do, I will always share the prompt and output.\n\nAI output can be a part of your responses on assignments, but it always needs to be accompanied by double-checking, commentary, and interpretation from you.\n\nWhy do I care about this? Again, I want to see and give feedback on your thinking. But also quite importantly, AI does not always generate complete and/or accurate output. Because of its training data, it will almost certainly hallucinate or give inaccurate information when asked about more modern advances in the field.\n\n\nPlease be aware of the following general limitations of AI:\n\nAI does not always generate accurate output. If it gives you a number, fact, or code, assume it is wrong unless you either know the answer or can check in with another source. AI works best for topics you already understand to a sufficient extent.\nIf you provide minimum effort prompts, you will get low quality results. You will need to refine your prompts in order to get good outcomes. This will take work.\nBe thoughtful about when this tool is useful. Don’t use it if it isn’t appropriate for the case or circumstance.\nThe environmental impact of AI should not be ignored. The building and usage of AI tools consume a lot of energy (see here and here). For this reason, let’s be thoughtful about when we use AI and think about other sustainability behaviors that we can incorporate into our lives to offset this usage.\n\nIf you have any questions about your use of AI tools, please contact me to discuss them."

Increasing the amount of exposure should generally lead to a more pronounced effect.\nPlausibility: Being able to explain why. A reported relationship is more plausible if there are reasonable mechanism(s) for the relationship. (Knowledge of the mechanism is limited by current knowledge.)\nCoherence: The coherence between different sources of evidence (e.g., epidemiological and laboratory findings).\nExperiment: Evidence from controlled experiments can be compelling.\nAnalogy: The observed association is just like (analogous to) some other association.\n\nLucy D’Agostino McGowan at Vanderbilt came up with a great mapping between these criteria and xkcd cartoons–see here for her full talk.

There’s absolutely a technical element to causal inference, and we’ll get to some of that in this book. But when you talk to people who actually do causal research, they think of this stuff intuitively first, not mathematically. They talk about assumptions about the real world and whether they’re reasonable, and what the story is behind the data. After they’ve got that settled, then they worry about equations and statistical properties. Designing good research and proving (or even understanding) statistical theorems are separate tasks. I think they should be introduced in that order.\nThe Effect - Introduction"

(No PDFs because comments end up being too scrunched in PDFs.) If submitting a Google Doc, make sure that I am added with either Editing or Commenting privileges.\nPrompt:\nI recently read a moving essay called An Education of His Own by writer Latham Turner. I invite you to read this essay as you think about what you might want from this course experience. If you feel so moved, I’d love to hear what parts of the essay resonated with you.\nWhat would make this course of a success for you? What are you hoping to learn and accomplish? I know that there are a variety of reasons for taking the course, and I want to better understand how those reasons inform what you are hoping for.\nReflect on other courses you’ve taken and other learning environments in which you’ve participated. What grading/motivation/incentive structures, classroom dynamics, and personal habits/practices were helpful for your learning? What hindered your learning?\nFor the next questions, I want to be honest with you about where I am coming from. I mentioned in the syllabus that if I didn’t have to give grades, I wouldn’t. The act of grading (putting points and A/B/C-like marks on work) is quite draining for me because I feel immense pressure to be fair, be “accurate” (even though there is no way that something like a grade could accurately measure something as complex as learning), and keep your motivation levels high. I also feel that grading creates a charged power dynamic between the instructor and the student that I don’t like. I became a teacher because I love being a guide and a coach for students in ideas I find fascinating—not because I wanted to bestow judgment.\nIf my aversion to grades seems like an aversion to high expectations for your learning, it’s not. It’s an aversion to what I see as a very problematic system when something more simple and more meaningful encourages learning so well: qualitative feedback. Note that grading is very different from qualitative feedback, which, simply put, is a collection of thoughtful comments on your work. I truly enjoy giving feedback when it is not tied to a grade. There’s so much rich information in qualitative feedback that grades, by virtue of being a single letter or number, can’t capture.\nWith that background from me, I have a few questions for you: How would you feel about a system in which everyone gets an A so that we can ignore grades completely and focus on qualitative feedback? How would you feel about a system in which everyone was graded differently? How do you think we should approach the process of deciding to how to handle grades in this course?\nI know that the background I gave suggests what I would prefer for what we do with grades. I know that this may affect your comfort in being honest, but I truly do want to know your honest thoughts.\nThanks for taking the time to reflect and share with me. I’m looking forward to reading what you write.\n\n\n\nAssignment 2\nDue Friday, 9/27 at 5pm on Moodle\nImagine that you are preparing your capstone talk on your project from this course. The start of that presentation should probably include a section that introduces orients them to what the course is even about: What is causal inference? What are causal graphs, and what role do they play in causal inference?\nTask: Create slides for this presentation section. Add presenter notes beneath each slide to indicate what you would say. If you wish, you can record a video of you giving this presentation segment.\nAudience: Aim for this presentation segment to be accessible to students who have taken STAT 155 but no upper-level courses.\nFormat:\n\nFor submitting slides, Google Slides is preferred—make sure that I am added with either Editing or Commenting privileges. If using another program for slides, submit both the slides and presenter notes beneath in PDF format.\nIf submitting a video, upload the video or share a link where I can access it."

These two variables define 4 blocks or strata:\n\nAge = young, prior exp = low: 6 units\nRandomization: 0 0 1 1 0 1\nAge = young, prior exp = high: 8 units\nRandomization: 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1\nAge = old, prior exp = low: 4 units\nRandomization: 1 0 0 1\nAge = old, prior exp = high: 6 units\nRandomization: 1 1 0 0 1 0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking the balance of a randomization\nAfter obtaining a random assignment, it is important to check that the treatment groups are balanced in terms of variables that affect the outcome.\nThe cobalt package provides a convenient way to do this with the bal.tab() function:\n\nset.seed(451)\nn &lt;- 1000\nsim_data &lt;- tibble(\n    A = sample(c(rep(0, n/2), rep(1, n/2))),\n    C1 = rnorm(n, mean = 2, sd = 1),\n    C2 = rnorm(n, mean = 2, sd = 1),\n    mean_Y = A + C1 + C2,\n    noise_Y = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 5),\n    Y = mean_Y + noise_Y\n)\n\n# The bal.tab() function from the cobalt package\n# automatically computes balance statistics\n# Continuous variables: standardized mean differences (difference in means divided by a pooled estimate of the std dev from both groups)\n# Binary variables: raw differences in proportion\nbal.tab(A ~ C1 + C2, data = sim_data, s.d.denom = \"pooled\")\n\nBalance Measures\n      Type Diff.Un\nC1 Contin.  0.0341\nC2 Contin.  0.0464\n\nSample sizes\n    Control Treated\nAll     500     500\n\n\n\n\n\nPrecision variables\nQuestion: Based on the simulation code below, what causal graph represents the data-generating process? What can you infer is the causal effect of A on Y?\n\nset.seed(451)\nn &lt;- 1000\nsim_data &lt;- tibble(\n    A = sample(c(rep(0, n/2), rep(1, n/2))),\n    C1 = rnorm(n, mean = 2, sd = 1),\n    C2 = rnorm(n, mean = 2, sd = 1),\n    C3 = rnorm(n, mean = 2, sd = 1),\n    C4 = rnorm(n, mean = 2, sd = 1),\n    mean_Y = 5*A + C1 + C2 + C3 + C4,\n    noise_Y = rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 5),\n    Y = mean_Y + noise_Y\n)\n\nThe simulation below uses the same RCT data-generating process as above. It conducts 1000 of these RCTs and fits two different models. Read through this code to understand what is being done.

How might we adapt the simulation setup above to investigate how adjusting for proxies changes the comparison between the unadjusted and adjusted models?",

(Inspired by a 1970s study on the relationship between estrogen use and endometrial cancer.)\nResearchers have noticed a consistent association between use of a certain drug and disease. Research groups debated two hypotheses:\n\nThe drug does cause disease.\nThe drug doesn’t actually cause disease but leads to a side effect, leading to more frequent doctor visits, leading to increased diagnosis of existing disease.\n\nThe following study plan was proposed: restrict the study only to those with side effects and compare disease rates in drug-users and non-users. In this way, all participants have the same chance of being diagnosed.\nThe following causal graphs correspond to the two hypotheses:\n\n\n\n(The graphs don’t show confounders of the drug-true disease relationship for compactness. We can assume that these have already been adjusted for.)\n\nStudy design 1\nConsider the study proposal above: restrict analysis to those with side effects.\n\nBefore looking at the causal graphs: does the rationale for this study design make sense? Why did researchers want to only look at patients with side effects?\nUnder this study design, the researchers were expecting that if Hypothesis 1 were correct (the drug does cause disease), they would find an association between drug use and diagnosed disease. They expected that if Hypothesis 2 were correct (the drug does NOT cause disease), they would find NO association between drug use and diagnosed disease.\n\nAre these expectations correct? Explain in light of the causal graphs.\n\nBased on your answer above, is this an effective study design for the research questions of interest? That is, can this study proposal distinguish between the two hypotheses?\n\n\n\nStudy design 2\nConsider another study proposal: ensure that everyone is screened for disease frequently, and we don’t restrict our analysis to only those with side effects.\n\nWhat arrow can be removed as a result of this study design? (It might help to draw an updated version of DAGs 1 and 2 with this arrow removed.)\nUnder this study design, the researchers had the same expectations: if Hypothesis 1 were correct, they would find an association between drug use and diagnosed disease. If Hypothesis 2 were correct, they would find NO association between drug use and diagnosed disease.\n\nAre these expectations correct?

Flagship state universities tend to be the premier public colleges in the state. They are often the first college to have been established in the state and the most research-intensive with more resources.\nIn the first figure, the x-axis indicates the number of SAT points away from the admissions cutoff for the state flagship (a recentered SAT score). (The cutoff is a strongly suggested but not a hard cutoff for admission.) Each point shows the enrollment rate at the flagship university for that recentered SAT score. The solid lines show nonlinear trends fitted separately to the left and to the right of x=0. The t=10.57 indicates a test statistic for a hypothesis test on the jump at x=0.\n\nIn the second figure, the x-axis is the same, and the y-axis represents the natural log earnings after calendar year, years of work experience, and graduation year have been accounted for (which is what the “(Residual)” part of the axis label is indicating). (More details are described in this section of our Mixtape textbook.) The z=3.01 indicates a test statistic for a hypothesis test on the jump at x=0.\n\n\nWhat story do you think the author is trying to tell with these figures?\nIf the admissions cutoff did not exist, what do you think the relationship between enrollment rate and SAT points would look like? What about the relationship between earnings and SAT points?\nHow different do you think students just below and just above the admission cutoff are?

This time we use type = \"missing.edge\" instead of type = \"all.pairs\".\n\nBecause this graph is so much more complex, checking for conditional independence between all pairs of variables results in a ton of conditional independence statements. (In fact, there are 7182 of them.)\nWhen using “missing.edge” we focus on conditional independencies that arise from a missing edge between two variables. This results in a much more manageable set of conditional independence statements to test.\n\n\nprotein_dag_cis &lt;- impliedConditionalIndependencies(protein_dag, type = \"missing.edge\")\n\nIn the code chunk below, use the appropriate type argument in localTests() to perform the CI tests.\n\nNote: The R = 100 argument is needed for this type to set the number of bootstrapping iterations for obtaining the confidence interval.\n\n\n# Obtain and display a data frame of CI test results\n# We use a subset of the protein data for computational time reasons\n# The system.time() function measures how long a command takes to run\nsystem.time({\nprotein_dag_ci_test_res &lt;- localTests(protein_dag, data = protein_data_subs, tests = protein_dag_cis, type = ___, R = 100)\n})\n\nprotein_dag_ci_test_res\n\nWe can plot the results of these tests with the plotLocalTestResults() function from dagitty.

    "text": "Day 2: Simulating data using causal graphs (9/11)\nBefore class:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequired\n\n\n\n\nVideo: Key structures in causal graphs (~12 min) (slides)\n\nNote 1: In this video, I refer to a concept called “exchangeability”. This is a concept that I included in the last offering of this course. Exchangeability is a causal identification assumption. When the exchangeability assumption is satisfied, we can identify causal effects. When it is not satisfied, I call this “a lack of exchangeability”. In the language we have used, this happens when there are alternate (noncausal) explanations for a relationship between two variables. So in the video, whenever you hear “creates a lack of exchangeability”, replace that with “leads to the presence of alternate (noncausal) explanations for the relationship between two variables”. When you hear “achieve conditional exchangeability”, replace that with “we are able to address this alternate explanation when analyzing the data”.\nNote 2: I use the formal probability ideas of marginal and conditional dependence and independence. You can get the essential ideas from this video by replacing terms in the list below. (If you want to learn or review these probability ideas (not required!), watch my Probability Essentials video.)\n\n“A and B are marginally [independent/dependent]” = “A and B are [unrelated/related] in a general population”\n“A and B are conditionally independent” = “A and B are [unrelated/related] in subgroups (in each group defined by one or more variables)”\n\n\n2 readings from Andrew Heiss’s Program Evaluation course:\n\nGenerating random numbers (~35 min)\nThe ultimate guide to generating synthetic data for causal inference (Stop when you get to the subsection “Visualizing one variable”) (~25 min)\n\n\n\n\nDuring class: Simulating data using causal graphs"
