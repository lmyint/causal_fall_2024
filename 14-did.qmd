# Example: Triskaidekaphobia and apartment prices

Read the article [Why do buildings skip the thirteenth floor?](https://academic.oup.com/jrssig/article/21/2/16/7641894)

After reading, answer the following with your group:

- How did the authors apply the difference-in-differences (DiD) framework to this setting?
- Do you think the assumptions they made were reasonable?
- What regression model underlies their DiD analyses?
- Why did the authors repeat their analyses after matching relabelled and not relabelled apartment buildings?
