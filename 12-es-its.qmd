# Discussion

Interrupted times series (event studies) are perhaps the most natural study design for assessing causal effects:

- An event happens---compare what was happening before and after the event (hence the name "event study")
- To frame it another way, we have a time series of the outcome evolving over time, an event happens, and that time series gets interrupted and changes after the event (hence the name "interrupted time series" (ITS))

**Autocorrelation** is an important statistical consideration when looking at ITS data: the outcome at a given time will almost certainly be correlated with the outcome at previous times.

- We need to account for this autocorrelation when estimating standard errors.
- If we don't, we will likely underestimate standard errors.
    - Correlation between cases reduces the effective sample size. If we have two observations that are highly correlated, we don't really have two full units of information.
    - In the most extreme case, we could take our dataset and just copy and paste it twice. We really only have one dataset's worth of information even if we have twice as many cases.


<br><br><br><br>


An ITS design is rather similar to a regression discontinuity design with time as the running variable.

But when time is the running variable, an important source of bias is relevant: **history bias**. 

- This refers to the fact that other events that influence the outcome can happen at (or around) the same time as the intervention.
- e.g., If the intervention is a new law, confounding events could include other laws that were introduced at roughly the same time or major economic events (like recessions).
- We need to think carefully about the data context 


<br><br><br><br>


A **comparative interrupted time series design** is an extension of the ITS that not only looks at the outcome time series in the treatment unit(s) but also in **control units**.

- Control units will not have experienced the intervention during the time period under study but SHOULD have experienced the confounding events.

One example:

Another example: [Figure 3](https://academic.oup.com/view-large/figure/226574210/dyaa152f3.tif) from the article [Can synthetic controls improve causal inference in interrupted time series evaluations of public health interventions?](https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyaa152)


<br><br><br><br>


**Exercise:** A general model for the trends in outcomes before and after the intervention in treatment and control units is given below. (This model doesn't adjust for any seasonal periodicity in the outcome. Accounting for seasonality doesn't change the fundamental insights from this exercise, but we'll look at modeling seasonality next time.)

Variables:

- `post`: 1 if observation is in the post-intervention time period, 0 if in pre-period
- `treated`: 1 if observation is from a treated unit, 0 if control
- `T`: time (will be centered at the time of intervention $T_0$)

$$
E[Y \mid \text{post,treated},T] = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{post} + \beta_2\text{treated} + \beta_3(T-T_0) + \beta_4\text{post}\times\text{treated} + \beta_5\text{treated}\times(T-T_0) + \beta_6\text{post}\times (T-T_0) + \beta_7\text{post}\times\text{treated}\times (T-T_0)
$$

Write out the model formulas for $Y$ as a function of (centered) time ($T-T_0$) in the treated and controls units, in the pre-intervention and post-intervention periods. Draw a diagram showing the 4 trends. Label slopes and intercepts.

- What coefficient(s) govern how similar the treatment and control units are in the pre-intervention time period?
- What coefficient(s) govern the discontinuity in the trend at $T_0$?
