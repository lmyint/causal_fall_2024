# Goals

- Explain how d-separation and causal/noncausal paths relate to identification of causal effects.
- Apply d-separation to block noncausal paths in causal DAGs with and without unobserved variables.
- Apply strategies to deal with identification problems caused by unobserved variables.
- Differentiate confounding and selection bias in terms of graph structure and how they arise in applied studies.

# Exercises

## Exercise 1

For each of the causal graphs below, identify the set of variables needed to block noncausal paths (if possible) between treatment $A$ and outcome $Y$. Any $U$ variables displayed in the graphs are unobserved/unmeasured.

```{r 05_ex1, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.width=11, fig.height=4, fig.align="center"}
library(dagitty)
dag1 <- dagitty("dag {
bb=\"0,0,1,1\"
A [exposure,pos=\"0.252,0.350\"]
L [pos=\"0.185,0.268\"]
U [latent,pos=\"0.124,0.176\"]
Y [outcome,pos=\"0.498,0.350\"]
A -> Y
L -> A
U -> L
U -> Y
}
")
dag2 <- dagitty("dag {
bb=\"0,0,1,1\"
A [exposure,pos=\"0.252,0.350\"]
L [pos=\"0.299,0.254\"]
M [pos=\"0.373,0.350\"]
U [latent,pos=\"0.124,0.176\"]
Y [outcome,pos=\"0.498,0.350\"]
A -> M
L -> Y
M -> Y
U -> A
U -> L
}
")
dag3 <- dagitty("dag {
bb=\"0,0,1,1\"
A [exposure,pos=\"0.252,0.350\"]
L [pos=\"0.373,0.245\"]
M1 [pos=\"0.373,0.350\"]
M2 [pos=\"0.373,0.445\"]
U1 [latent,pos=\"0.252,0.141\"]
U2 [latent,pos=\"0.495,0.146\"]
Y [outcome,pos=\"0.495,0.350\"]
A -> M1
A -> M2
M1 -> Y
M2 -> Y
U1 -> A
U1 -> L
U2 -> L
U2 -> Y
}
")
dag4 <- dagitty("dag {
bb=\"0,0,1,1\"
A [exposure,pos=\"0.400,0.350\"]
L [pos=\"0.200,0.350\"]
U1 [latent,pos=\"0.100,0.200\"]
U2 [latent,pos=\"0.100,0.500\"]
Y [outcome,pos=\"0.600,0.350\"]
A -> Y
L -> A
U1 -> L
U1 -> Y
U2 -> A
U2 -> L
}
")

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(dag1)
plot(dag2)
plot(dag3)
plot(dag4)
```

## Exercise 2

Historically, people have tried to create definitions for confounders by listing criteria that purely rely on associations. For example:

> A confounder must:    
> 1. Be associated with treatment and outcome    
> 2. Not be caused by treatment

Using the causal graph below, explain why this is not a good definition for a confounder.

```{r 06_ex2, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, fig.align="center"}
plot(dag3)
```



## Exercise 3

First, think through the relationships depicted in the causal graphs below and whether they make sense. These are intended to reflect a range of scenarios for why people drop out of studies.

Then for each of the graphs, identify the set of variables needed to achieve conditional exchangeability of the treatment $A$ and outcome $Y$. ($U$ and $W$ are unmeasured.) Check your answers to one of the graphs using [DAGitty](http://www.dagitty.net/dags.html).

## Exercise 4

In this exercise, we'll consider how causal graphs can inform study design. (Inspired by a 1970s study on the relationship between estrogen use and endometrial cancer.)

Researchers have noticed a consistent association between use of a certain drug and disease. Research groups debated two hypotheses:

1. The drug does cause disease.
2. The drug doesn't actually cause disease but leads to a side effect, leading to more frequent doctor visits, leading to increased diagnosis of existing disease.

The following study plan was proposed: restrict the study only to those with side effects and compare disease rates in drug-users and non-users. In this way, all participants have the same chance of being diagnosed.

The following causal graphs correspond to the two hypotheses:

<center>
![](images/estrogens_endometrial_generalized.png)
</center>

(The graphs don't show confounders of the drug-true disease relationship for compactness. We can assume that these have already been adjusted for.)

### Study design 1

Consider the study proposal above: restrict analysis to those with side effects.

- Before looking at the causal graphs: does the rationale for this study design make sense? Why did researchers want to only look at patients with side effects?

- Under this study design, the researchers were expecting that if Hypothesis 1 were correct (the drug does cause disease), they would find an association between drug use and diagnosed disease. They expected that if Hypothesis 2 were correct (the drug does NOT cause disease), they would find NO association between drug use and diagnosed disease.
    - Are these expectations correct? Explain in light of the causal graphs.

- Based on your answer above, is this an effective study design for the research questions of interest? That is, can this study proposal distinguish between the two hypotheses?

### Study design 2

Consider another study proposal: ensure that *everyone* is screened for disease frequently, and we don't restrict our analysis to only those with side effects.

- What arrow can be removed as a result of this study design? (It might help to draw an updated version of DAGs 1 and 2 with this arrow removed.)

- Under this study design, the researchers had the same expectations: if Hypothesis 1 were correct, they would find an association between drug use and diagnosed disease. If Hypothesis 2 were correct, they would find NO association between drug use and diagnosed disease.
    - Are these expectations correct? Explain in light of the causal graphs.

- Based on your answer above, is this an effective study design for the research questions of interest? That is, can this study proposal distinguish between the two hypotheses?
